    "There are a huge range of input and output formats available in **pandas**: Stata (.dta), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), csv, tsv, big data formats (HDF5, parquet), JSON, SAS, SPSS, SQL, and more; there's a [full list](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) of formats available in the documentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reading data from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the power needed to open plain-text table files is contained in a single function, `pd.read_csv`. It takes numerous arguments but the two most important are the (unnamed) first one, which gives the path to the data, and `sep=` (a keyword argument) that tells **pandas** whether to expect values to be separated by commas or tabs or another character; however, if you leave this field blank, **pandas** will guess for you. To see the full set of arguments, run `help(pd.read_csv)`.\n",
