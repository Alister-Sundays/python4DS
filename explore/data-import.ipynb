    "\n",
    "### Reading data from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the power needed to open plain-text table files is contained in a single function, `pd.read_csv`. It takes numerous arguments but the two most important are the (unnamed) first one, which gives the path to the data, and `sep=` (a keyword argument) that tells **pandas** whether to expect values to be separated by commas or tabs or another character; however, if you leave this field blank, **pandas** will guess for you. To see the full set of arguments, run `help(pd.read_csv)`.\n",
