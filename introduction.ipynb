The goal of “Python for Data Science” is to help you learn the most important tools and workflows in Python that will allow you to do data science. After reading this book, you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challenges!\n",

    "Data science is a vast field, and there's no way you can master it all by reading a single book. This book aims to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary. Our model of the tools needed in a typical data science project looks something like this:"

    "First you must **import** your data into Python. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API), and load it into a 'data frame' in Python. You can't data science without data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've imported your data, it is usually necessary to **clean** or tidy it. Cleaning your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. This is fancy way of saying that the data are in a format that you can work easily with! So-called \"tidy\" data is a special case of structured tabular data in which each column is a variable, and each row is an observation (but not all data are tabular). Clean data are important because consistent structure lets you focus your efforts on answering questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have clean data, a common next step is to **transform** it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have clean data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: visualisation and analysis. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses so any real analysis will iterate between them many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualisation** is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualisation might also hint that you're asking the wrong question, or that you need to collect different data. Visualisations can surprise you! They come in different flavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis** is a topic that's too big to cover in this book. It might involve running models, doing statistics, answering specific questions, or drawing a narrative out of the data. It's an important skill, but one that's highly dependent on the domain of application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of data science is **communication**, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. It doesn't matter how well your models and visualisation have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounding all these tools is **programming**. Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in nearly every part of a data science project. You don't need to be an expert programmer to be a successful data scientist, but learning more about programming pays off, because becoming a better programmer allows you to automate common tasks, and solve new problems with greater ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use these tools in every data science project but, for most projects, they won't be enough alone. There's a rough 80/20 rule in play; you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools that you'll learn in this book, but you'll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20%. Throughout this book, we'll point you to resources where you can learn more.\n"

    "## How this book is organised\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous description of the tools of data science is organised roughly according to the order in which you use them in an analysis (although of course you'll iterate through them multiple times). In our experience, however, *this is not the best way to learn them*. This is because starting with data ingest and cleaning tends to be either routine and boring or weird and frustrating—both of which can be offputting when you're starting to learn a new subject!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll start with visualisation and transformation of data that's already been imported and cleaned. That way, when you ingest and clean your own data, your motivation will stay high because you know the pain is worth the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each chapter, we try and adhere to a similar pattern: start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned. Although it can be tempting to skip the exercises, there's no better way to learn than practicing on real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you won't learn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of important topics that this book doesn't cover. We believe it's important to stay ruthlessly focused on the essentials so you can get up and running as quickly as possible. That means this book can't cover every important topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling is incredibly important for data science, but it’s a big topic, and unfortunately, we just don’t have the space to give it the coverage it deserves here. Some great places to start are the [sklearn tutorials for machine learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html), [Causal inference for the brave and true](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook) and the *Coding for Economists*' pages on [regression](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/econmt-regression.html) and [Bayesian inference](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/econmt-bayesian.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big data\n",
    "\n",
    "This book focuses on small, \"in-memory\" (more or less this means you can open them on your laptop) datasets. This is the right place to start because you can't tackle big data unless you have experience with small data. The tools you learn in this book will easily handle hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a little care, you can typically use them to work with 1-2 Gb (gigabytes) of data. If you're routinely working with larger data (10-100 Gb, say), you should learn more about databases and tools such as [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) that let you interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If your data is bigger than this, carefully consider whether your big data problem is actually a small data problem in disguise. While the complete data set might be big, often the data needed to answer a specific question is small. You might be able to find a subset, subsample, or summary that fits in memory and still allows you to answer the question that you're interested in. The challenge here is finding the right small data, which often requires a lot of iteration.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is that your big data problem is actually a large number of small data problems in disguise. Each individual problem might fit in memory, but you have millions of them. For example, you might want to fit a model to each person in your dataset. This would be trivial if you had just 10 or 100 people, but instead you have a million. Fortunately, each problem is independent of the others (a setup that is sometimes called embarrassingly parallel), so you just need a system (like [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) or [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)) that allows you to send different datasets to different computers for processing. Once you've figured out how to answer your question for a single subset using the tools described in this book, you can learn new tools like **pyspark** to solve it for the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R, Julia, and friends\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, you won't learn anything about R, Julia, or any other programming language useful for data science. This isn't because we think these tools are bad. They're not! And in practice, most data science teams use a mix of languages, typically R and Python. However, you may find it easier to learn one tool at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book uses Python, which is usually ranked as the first or second most popular programming language in the world and, just as importantly, it’s also one of the easiest to learn. It’s a general purpose language, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks. This combination of features is why people say Python has a low floor and a high ceiling. It’s also very versatile; the joke goes that Python is the 2nd best language at everything, and there’s some truth to that (although Python is 1st best at some tasks, like machine learning). But a language that covers such a lot of ground is also very useful; and Python is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector, and is often taught in schools too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We think Python is a great place to start your data science journey because it is the most popular tool for data science and programming more generally, with a large community behind it.\n",

    "## Running Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will create and run your first code. If you get stuck, there's a more in-depth tutorial over at the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new folder for your work (perhaps named 'python4DS', no white space), open that folder with Visual Studio Code and create a new file, naming it `hello_world.py`. The file extension, `.py`, is very important as it implicitly tells Visual Studio Code that this is a Python script. In the Visual Studio Code editor, add a single line to the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you named this file with the extension `.py` then VS Code will recognise that it is Python code and you should see the name and version of Python pop up in the blue bar at the bottom of your VS Code window. Make sure that the version of Python displayed here is the Anaconda version that you just installed rather than one that comes built-in with your operating system (this is particularly an issue on Mac). If you have a fresh install of Anaconda's distribution of Python, you'll probably see something like `Python 3.9 64-bit ('base': conda)`. To change which Python version your code uses, click on the version shown in the blue bar and select the version you want. If you've just changed Python version, it can be a good idea to restart VS Code so that all the versions of Python on your system are picked up by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you press save, you may get messages about installing extra packages or making Pylance your default language server; just go with VS Code's suggestions here, except the one about the terminal and conda, which you can say no to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, shall we actually run some code? Select/highlight the `print('Hello world!')` text you typed in the file and right-click to bring up some options including 'Run Selection/Line in Terminal' and `Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window'. Because VS Code is a richly featured IDE, there are lots of options for how to run the file. Let's try both of the main ways: via the interactive window and using the \"terminal\" (more on what that is later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive window is a convenient and flexible way to run code that you have open in a script or that you type directly into the interactive window code box. The interactive window will 'remember' any variables that have been assigned (for examples, code statements like `x = 5`), whether they came from running some lines in your script or from you typing them in directly. Working with the interactive window will feel familiar to anyone who has used Stata, Matlab, or R, and is much more suited to the way economists tend to work because it doesn't require you to write the whole script, start to finish, ahead of time. Instead, you can jam, changing code as you go, (re-)running it line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in an interactive window, **right-click and select 'Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window'**. This should cause a new 'interactive' panel to appear within Visual Studio Code, and only the selected line will execute within it. At this point, you may see a message about Visual Studio Code's default behaviour when you press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>; for this book, it's good to have <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> default to running a line in the interactive window. The box below has instructions for how to ensure this always happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Make code run in the interactive window by default\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up Visual Studio Code and go to settings (click on the cog in the bottom left-hand corner, then click settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 'python send' into the search box. Depending on your configuration and Visual Studio Code version, you will either see 'Python › Data Science: Send Selection To Interactive Window' or 'Jupyter: Send Selection To Interactive Window'. Make sure that there is a tick in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that when you hit shift+enter on code scripts, it will execute your code in Visual Studio's interactive window (starting a new window if necessary).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make more use of the interactive window. At the bottom of it, there is a box that says 'Type code here and press shift-enter to run'. Go ahead and type `print('Hello World!')` directly in there to achieve the same effect as running the line from your script. Also, any variables you run in the interactive window (from your script or directly by entering them in the box) will persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how variables persist, type `hello_string = 'Hello World!'` into the interactive window's code entry box and hit shift-enter. If you now type `hello_string` and hit shift+enter, you will see the contents of the variable you just created. You can also click the grid symbol at the top of the interactive window (between the stop symbol and the save file symbol); this is the variable explorer and will pop open a panel showing all of the variables you've created in this interactive session. You should see one called `hello_string` of type `str` with a value `Hello World!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the two ways of working with the interactive window--running (segments) from a script, or writing code directly in the entry box.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Start interactive windows and terminals within your project directory\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "In Visual Studio Code, you can ensure that the interactive window starts in the root directory of your project by setting \"Jupyter: Notebook File Root\" to `${workspaceFolder}` in the Settings menu. For the integrated command line, change \"Terminal › Integrated: Cwd\" to `${workspaceFolder}` too.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code the other way, in the terminal, right-click and select 'Run Python file in terminal'. This will bring up a new panel (called a terminal) *within* Visual Studio Code that runs your entire script from top to bottom-and you should see 'Hello World!' pop up! Although we're trying out running code in the terminal, the typical economics workflow would be to work with the interactive window.\n",
