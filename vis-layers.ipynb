    "In the previous chapters, you've learned much more than just how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots.\n",
    "You learned a foundation that you can use to make *any* type of plot with **lets-plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll expand on that foundation as you learn about the layered grammar of graphics.\n",
    "We'll start with a deeper dive into aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and facets.\n",
    "Then, you will learn about statistical transformations **lets-plot** makes under the hood when creating a plot.\n",
    "These transformations are used to calculate new values to plot, such as the heights of bars in a bar plot or medians in a box plot.\n",
    "You will also learn about position adjustments, which modify how geoms are displayed in your plots.\n",
    "Finally, we'll briefly introduce coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not cover every single function and option for each of these layers, but we will walk you through the most important and commonly used functionality provided by **lets-plot**."
