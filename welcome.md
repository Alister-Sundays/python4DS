# Welcome

This is the website for **Python for Data Science**, a book heavily inspired by [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

This book will teach you the basics of doing data science with Python: you'll learn how to get your data into Python, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, and visualise it.
